            The Studio module creates metadata describing domain entities and relationships between them.
            <br>
            For example, the Blog application consists of the Article, Category, Comment, and others classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The created entities are in a separate store.
            Export them to <b>metadata/app</b> folder to load into the application.

            Attribute describes a single class element.<br>
            For example, the Article class consists of the Title, Content, Date and other attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each attribute has a specific type depending on stored data.
            <br>
            For example, the Title attribute is of type String, the Content attribute is of type Text.

            Attribute types Reference and Back reference define relationship between classes.
            Link settings are on the Relation tab.
            <br>
            The Reference type stores the link directly in the class instance.
            For example, a comment has a link to the article it refers to.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Back reference type retrieves the link data from the object of the referenced class.
            <br>
            For example, comments for an article are retrieved from a back reference,
            because each comment stores an article ID. The article itself does not store any data about comments.
        </p>
        <p>
            The linking can be multiple or single.
            <br>
            An article link in a comment is an example of a single link.
            A link to comments in an article is an examples of a multiple link.

            The view overrides class parameters for specific use cases.
            <br>
            For example, when displaying objects in a list, only selected attributes can be shown.
        </p>
        <p>
            The codename "list" is used to represent objects in the list.
            <br>
            The codename "create" is used to represent the object when it is created.
            <br>
            The codename "edit" is used to represent the object when editing.
            <br>
            The codename "eager" is used to represent the eager load object.
